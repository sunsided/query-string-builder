## [0.6.0] - 2024-06-08

[0.6.0]: https://github.com/sunsided/query-string-builder/releases/tag/v0.6.0

### Added

- The `QueryString::simple` function was added to construct the new `QueryStringSimple` type.
  This type reduces string allocations, defers rendering and can keep references
  but at the cost of a complex type signature slightly more rigid handling.

### Changed

- The `QueryString::new` function was renamed to `QueryString::dynamic`.

## [0.5.1] - 2024-05-24

[0.5.1]: https://github.com/sunsided/query-string-builder/releases/tag/v0.5.1

### Internal

- `write_char()` and `fmt()` calls are now used instead of `write!` when rendering the string.

## [0.5.0] - 2024-05-24

[0.5.0]: https://github.com/sunsided/query-string-builder/releases/tag/v0.5.0

### Changed

- [#3](https://github.com/sunsided/query-string-builder/pull/3):
  The functions now change inputs that implement `ToString` rather than requiring `Into<String>`.
  This allows for any `Display` types to be used directly.

## [0.4.2] - 2024-05-23

[0.4.2]: https://github.com/sunsided/query-string-builder/releases/tag/v0.4.2

### Added

- More characters are added to the encoding set to ensure recursive values
  (e.g. URLs as a value) decode reliably.

### Fixed

- The hash character `#` is now encoded in order to ensure correct parsing of query parameters.

[0.4.1]: https://github.com/sunsided/query-string-builder/releases/tag/0.4.1

[0.4.0]: https://github.com/sunsided/query-string-builder/releases/tag/0.4.0

### Added
